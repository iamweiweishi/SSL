# Things we have implemented 

1. Running of BYOL code 

### Things we have tested and verified 
1. Moving average (at least for tau = 0) 
2. MNIST dataset for 3 epochs - loss goes down but slowly 


### Things to work on 
1. Weight decay/regularisation (Page 9 of paper) - may have to implement in SimCLR too (Mathilde) 
2. Testing of code - loss should go down more significantly (Mun Fai) 
  - Work on Google Colab and run it for more epochs 
  - Perhaps increase LR 
  - Perhaps work with a pretrained model (e.g. pretrained ResNet 18) 
3. Extend to RGB datasets (e.g. CIFAR 10) (anyone) 
  - - Color augmentations for data transformations 
4. Closer resemblance to paper 
  - LARS optimiser 
    - check if tau(hyperparameter for Moving Average) is indeed going down
